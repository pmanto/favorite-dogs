# Favorite dogs
It's a single page application using a public api to get dogs media
- Next step: Tests: There are a few test, more tests are needed.
- To improve:
  - The favorites page doesn't have pagination
  - The way that the page is loading is not the best since the media takes some time to get the real size. Add some loading before showing all together.
  - Nav bar should be in a different component but since I haven't added redux or anything to share data between components, it's in the App for now.
